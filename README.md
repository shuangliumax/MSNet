# A Mixed-Scale Self-Distillation Network for Accurate Ship Detection in SAR Images
This repository contains the code for the paper "[A Mixed-Scale Self-Distillation Network for Accurate Ship Detection in SAR Images](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/10285007)".

The code framework of our proposed method is built based on Faster R-CNN, and the implementation details can be found at (https://github.com/sovit-123/fasterrcnn-pytorch-training-pipeline].
